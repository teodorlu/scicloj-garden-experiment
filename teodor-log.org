** a teodor log???
Yeah, I'd like a place to dump things when I work.

Under no circumstances do you have to read this file in order to understand things!
** where to start??
Clojure camp thread on Slack:

Teodor curriculum map draft:

** so, where to start?
I propose:

1. We copy the EDN file over
2. We setup a minimal structure to deploy that same page from this repo

Assumptions:

1. We use Cloudflare pages like I did last time.
2. We do _not_ build a super-duper flexible build system, we stick to simple things.
